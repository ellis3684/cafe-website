# cafe-website

This website was created using a database that shows a list of work-friendly cafes in London. The website includes CRUD functionality, 
using a Bootstrap-designed front-end to display the list of cafes. Cafes may be added or edited by any user, but deletion of cafes requires 
an API key. This website was created using Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS. Enjoy!
